# auth_actor

Authentication Application built using flutter

This is a simple Authenticator app which uses ```local_auth``` flutter package to verify the user's identity.
As per the package name I think nothing is sent elsewhere except the device. 

This application provides features to:
- Check if authentication is available
- List al the biometric types available
- Check for the authentication
- Report if authentication was successfull or not.

This is my second project as Android Development Intern at CodeClause.
